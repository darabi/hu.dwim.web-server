This is the collection of bugs and tasks for hu.dwim.wui as an
org-mode (http://orgmode.org) file.

Introduction
============

If you are using Linux, chances are that you can install org-mode from
your distro's package repository (in Debian/Ubuntu, the package is
called org-mode). After installation, the emacs info system contains a
chapter about org-mode. Try C-h i m org<TAB>.

To specify: 

1) the priority of a heading (A=highest to C=lowest), place
   the point on that heading and press S-<up> and S-<down>.

2) the status (TODO, DONE) of a heading, use S-<left> and S-<right>

3) assignee, type and severity of a topic, tags are used. Place the
   cursor on a heading and C-c t. You will be presented with a group
   of tags some of which are mutually exclusive (the shortcuts for the
   tags are given in parentheses):

   + Assignee: Attila(a), Levy(l), Tomi(t), Kami(k), Unassigned(u)
     
   + Type: BUG (B), FEATURE (F), TASK (T)

   + Severity: critical (c), major (m), minor (n), trivial (v)

You can add sub-headings to a heading by using one more asterisk at
the start of a new line. Try out TAB on a heading with sub-headings.

Useful commands:

- <tab>   expand collapse heading
- C-c /   org-sparse-tree
- C-c \   org-tags-sparse-tree
- C-c C-e org-export

* TODO [#A] make context-menu/widget rendering lazy                             :Unassigned:major:FEATURE:

Currently, all menus are rendered and sent to the browser
unconditionally, even if they are not visible (i.e. the menu item is
not yet clicked on).This leads to an increase in DOM size and slower
rendering.

We should use ajax on the client side to 

* DONE [#A] session timeout leads to 'unknown error at toplevel' in browser     :Unassigned:major:BUG:
  CLOSED: [2010-02-05 Fri 23:54]

Desired behaviour:

explicit error answer for ajax requests coming to non-existent
(probably timed out) sessions. tell the js side that the session does
not exist anymore


* TODO [#C] detect disabled cookies                                             :Unassigned:trivial:TASK:

Description:

Currently, when a user opens a wui based application with cookies
disabled, the page redirects infinitely. Some browsers (like FF3)
detect this and report it to the user with a message which mentions
disabled Cookies as one of possible reasons. Some browsers don't do
this and the user doesn't even know why the page doesn't load.

Desired Behaviour:

An error message which tells the user that session cookies have to be
enabled to be able to use the web app.
