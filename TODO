* TODO [#A] make context-menu/widget rendering lazy                             :Unassigned:major:FEATURE:

Currently, all menus are rendered and sent to the browser
unconditionally, even if they are not visible (i.e. the menu item is
not yet clicked on).This leads to an increase in DOM size and slower
rendering.

We should use ajax on the client side to download context menu on demand.

* DONE [#A] session timeout leads to 'unknown error at toplevel' in browser     :Attila:major:BUG:
  CLOSED: [2010-02-05 Fri 23:54]

Desired behaviour:

explicit error answer for ajax requests coming to non-existent
(probably timed out) sessions. tell the js side that the session does
not exist anymore
* TODO [#C] detect disabled cookies                                             :Unassigned:minor:TASK:

Description:

Currently, when a user opens a wui based application with cookies
disabled, the page redirects infinitely. Some browsers (like FF3)
detect this and report it to the user with a message which mentions
disabled Cookies as one of possible reasons. Some browsers don't do
this and the user doesn't even know why the page doesn't load.

Desired Behaviour:

An error message which tells the user that session cookies have to be
enabled to be able to use the web app.
* TODO [#C] think through ajax and actions                                      :Unassigned:minor:TASK:

Issues:
 - there's no support on the server side to make single-shot actions
 - rendering actions in command.lisp is a mess
 - the slot name 'ajax' is used for storing a dom-id, which is not suggested by its name
* TODO [#C] try to conflate applications/entry-points/servers into a uniform tree of brokers  :Unassigned:minor:TASK:
* DONE [#A] cookies are not stored when accessed through ip addresses or localhost :Unassigned:minor:BUG
